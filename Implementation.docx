 How Each Component Works
	1.	Scheduler

	•	Cron job or cloud scheduler
	•	Runs at 7–8 AM ET to scrape overnight + early morning news

	2.	News Scraper

	•	Fetch news from API / RSS / custom feeds
	•	Deduplicate articles
	•	Output: raw news JSON

	3.	Ticker Extraction + Market Snapshot

	•	Extract stock symbols
	•	Fetch premarket data:
	•	Previous close, gap %, premarket volume, SPY/QQQ trend

	4.	LLM Agents (LangGraph Pipeline)

	•	News Interpretation Agent → Is the news tradeable today? Direction & urgency
	•	Market Context Agent → Is the market supportive or risky?
	•	Technical Bias Agent → Price/volume analysis, trend confirmation
	•	Risk Judge Agent → Reads all previous outputs, decides: approve/reject/human

	5.	Decision Router (LangGraph)

	•	Routes based on decision field from Risk Judge:
	•	Approve → Execution
	•	Reject → Stop
	•	Human → Human Approval Node

	6.	Human Approval Node

	•	Optional override for trades
	•	Approve/reject trade
	•	Update state

	7.	Execution Node

	•	Paper trade (or live trading if safe)
	•	Follows pre-determined entry/stop/target
	•	Records outcome

	8.	Post-Trade Reflection Agent

	•	LLM reads trade + thesis + market data
	•	Generates insights & improvement suggestions
	•	Stores in DB for learning

⸻

 Key Features / Why This Is Strong
	•	 LLMs are used only for reasoning, not execution
	•	 Agents allow specialized analysis & conflict handling
	•	 LangGraph orchestrates dynamic routing + human-in-the-loop
	•	 Pre-market scraping ensures ready-to-trade watchlist before 9:30 AM
	•	 Post-trade reflection builds continuous improvement / memory

 Minimal Timeline Example (Daily Run)

Time (ET)	Action
07:00	Scheduler triggers scraper
07:00–07:30	Scrape & deduplicate news
07:30–08:30	Agents analyze news & market data
08:30–09:00	Human approval (if required)
09:00	Watchlist ready & trades queued
09:30	Market open, optional execution

 One-Sentence Explanation 

“Our system scrapes news before the market opens, uses specialized LLM agents to reason about news, market context, and technical bias, resolves conflicts through a LangGraph decision router with human oversight, and outputs a ready-to-trade watchlist before the market opens.”
